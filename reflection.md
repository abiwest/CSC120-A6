What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I liked learning how to implement unit testing because it seemed like a more foolproof way to figure out if my code is working how I intended, without simply running the whole thing. Also because I could just test a very small piece of code instead of the entire file/class. I had a relativly easy time at first creating the unit tests. When I was writing the engine and car class tests, and I was able to use pretty similar methods to the example that we did in class and the slides. When I got to the train unit tests, I kept getting error messages and after trying to fix those issues a bunch of times, I'm pretty sure that my train class itself has errors. So hopefully when you try using my tests with the correct code it will compile without errors.
